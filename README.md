## What This Is
Real Ones Only is a free educational web platform teaching young people:
- How money actually works (not the textbook version)
- How to earn online and build digital value
- How to think critically about the systems they live inside
- How to build something real — starting now, with zero dollars

Built by **Extxndo™ Development** — a self-taught Roblox developer who has earned $15,000+ online and believes the next generation deserves better than what schools currently provide.
